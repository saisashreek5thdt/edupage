              A desert is a large region that gets very little rain each year.
              Most deserts get less than 10 inches of rain in a year.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed font-Linotte font-medium text-justify">
              Some deserts are hot and some are cold. Some deserts are huge
              areas of sand while others have rocky hills and mountains. The
              Deserts are found on every continent, and they cover more than 20%
              of the Earth. They are classified into two types â€“ hot and cold
              based on their temperature.

            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed font-Linotte font-medium text-justify">
              Although both the lands are dry and have unfavourable climatic
              conditions, they are different from each other in terms of their
              climate and, flora and fauna. Very few plants or animals live in
              desert areas.
